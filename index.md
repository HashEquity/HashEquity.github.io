## Overview

HashEquity is a new enterprise application project under development to manage
the next new paradigm in shareholder equity. HashEquity is a security token 
that replaces the traditional utility of company “stock”, imputing ownership, 
dividends, voting-rights, and trading features to company shareholders. It is
 built on the Hedera network.

This distributed application (“dApp”) will be a critical enterprise tool to 
raise capital free of traditional 3rd party exchanges and brokerages. It will 
also provide a self-service enterprise platform to provide services such as 
EquityToken sale, trading and buy-back of its ShareToken on the Hedera network. 
Utilizing the Hedera ledger, EquityTokens will leverage much faster transaction 
and settlement time, ABFT security, crystal clear transparency, SEC compliance 
by design, and 24/7 liquidity at a fraction of the cost of traditional 
exchanges and brokerages.
