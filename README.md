# HashEquity

## Overview

HashEquity is a new enterprise application project under development to manage the next new paradigm in shareholder equity. HashEquity is a security token that replaces the traditional utility of company “stock”, imputing ownership, dividends, voting-rights, and trading features to company shareholders. It is built on the Hedera network.

This distributed application (“dApp”) will be a critical enterprise tool to raise capital free of traditional 3rd party exchanges and brokerages. It will also provide a self-service enterprise platform to provide services such as EquityToken sale, trading and buy-back of its ShareToken on the Hedera network. Utilizing the Hedera ledger, EquityTokens will leverage much faster transaction and settlement time, ABFT security, crystal clear transparency, SEC compliance by design, and 24/7 liquidity at a fraction of the cost of traditional exchanges and brokerages.
